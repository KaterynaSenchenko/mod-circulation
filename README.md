# Goal

FOLIO compatible circulation capabilities, including loan items from the inventory.

# Preparation

## Git Submodules

There are some common RAML definitions that are shared between FOLIO projects via Git submodules.

To initialise these please run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the root directory.

If these are not initialised, the inventory-storage module will fail to build correctly, and other operations may also fail.

More information is available on the [developer site](http://dev.folio.org/doc/setup#update-git-submodules).
